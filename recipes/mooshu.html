        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Mooshu is a cabbage and carrot vegetable stirfry, which
            can have pork or beef added to it. The stirfry is wrapped
            up in thin pancakes and dipped in a molasses, peanut butter,
            and soy sauce mixture called hoisin sauce. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Mooshu is not difficult to make and is a nice change from
            stirfry with rice.
